# Assignment Solutions

This package contains my solutions for the programming assignments in [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/) and [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/).

To set up the Java programming environment, see the instructions for [Mac OS X](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/mac), [Windows](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/windows), and [Linux](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/linux).

## Part I

- [`percolation`](./percolation/) finds the value of the **percolation threshold** via **Monte Carlo simulation** based on the **union-find** data structure.
- [`queues`](./queues/) implements the **double-ended queue** and **randomized queue** data structures.
- [`collinear`](./collinear/) finds collinear points in a point set using **comparison-based sorting** algorithms.
- [`8puzzle`](./8puzzle/) solves the generalized 8-puzzle problem using the **A* search** algorithm based on the **priority queue** data structure.
- [`kdtree`](./kdtree/) implements the **2d tree** data structure to support efficient **range search** and **nearest-neighbor search**.

## Part II

- [`wordnet`](./wordnet/) builds a rooted **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** data structure and looks for the **shortest common ancestor** of any two vertices.
- [`seam`](./seam/) implements content-aware image resizing algorithm based on algothms for finding the **single-source shortest path** in a **sparse graph**.
- [`baseball`](./baseball/) solves the baseball elimination problem using the **Ford--Fulkerson** algorithm for the **maxflow** problem.
- [`boggle`](./boggle/) plays the word game Boggle using the **R-way trie** data structure.
- [`burrows`](./burrows/) implement a **data compression** algorithm based on the **Burrows--Wheeler transform** and the **Huffman compression** algorithm.
