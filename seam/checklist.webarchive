</p><p><em>We haven't offered this assignment before, so we don't know what kinds of
questions students will have. We will add to the list as needed.</em>


</p><p><b>How do I manipulate images in Java?</b>
Use our <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/Picture.java.html">Picture</a>
data type (which is part of <code>stdlib.jar</code>)
and the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html">Color</a>
data type (which is part of the java.awt library).
Here is some more information about the
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/index.php#Color">Color</a>
and
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/index.php#Picture">Picture</a>
data types.
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Luminance.java.html">Luminance.java</a>
and
<a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/31datatype/Grayscale.java.html">Grayscale.java</a>
are example clients that use the <code>Color</code> and <code>Picture</code> data types, respectively.


</p><p><b>I noticed that the Picture API has a method to change the origin (0, 0)
from the upper teft to the lower left. Can I assume (0, 0) is the upper left pixel?</b>
Yes.

</p><p><b>Must the arguments to <code>removeHorizontalSeam()</code> and <code>removeVerticalSeam()</code>
be minimum energy seams?</b>
No. These methods should work for any valid seam (and throw an exception for any invalid seam).

</p><p><b>Clients.</b>&nbsp;
You may use the following client programs to test and debug your code.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<p></p><li>
<a href="../testing/seam/PrintEnergy.java">PrintEnergy.java</a>
computes and prints a table of the energy of an image with filename provided on the command line. 

<p></p></li><li>
<a href="../testing/seam/ShowEnergy.java">ShowEnergy.java</a>
computes and draws the energy of an image with filename provided on the command line.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href="../testing/seam/ShowSeams.java">ShowSeams.java</a>
computes the horizontal seam, vertical seam, and energy of the image with filename
provided on the command line. 
Draws the horizontal and vertical seams over the energy.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href="../testing/seam/PrintSeams.java">PrintSeams.java</a>
computes the horizontal seam, vertical seam, and energy of the image with
filename provided on the command line. 
Prints the horizontal and vertical seams as annotations to the energy.
Many of the small input files provided also 
have a <code>printseams.txt</code> file 
(such as <a href="../testing/seam/5x6.printseams.txt">5x6.printseams.txt</a>), so you can 
compare your results to the correct solution.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href="../testing/seam/ResizeDemo.java">ResizeDemo.java</a>
uses your seam removal methods to resize the image.
The command line arguments are filename, <em>W</em> and <em>H</em> where
<em>W</em> is the number of columns and <em>H</em> is the number rows to 
remove from the image specified.

<p></p></li><li>
<a href="../testing/seam/SCUtility.java">SCUtility.java</a>
is a utility program used by most of the above clients.



</li></ul>
<p><b>Sample input files.</b>
&nbsp;
The directory <a href="../testing/seam">seam</a> contains
the client programs above along with some sample image files.
For convenience,
<a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/seam-testing.zip">seam-test.zip</a>
contains all of these files bundled together.
You can also use your own image files for testing and entertainment.

<center><b>Possible Progress Steps</b></center>

</p><p>

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress.  You do
not have to follow these steps.

</p><ol>


<p></p><li>Start by writing the constructor as well as <code>picture()</code>, <code>width()</code> and <code>height()</code>.
These should be very easy. 

<p></p></li><li>From there, write <code>energy()</code>.
Calculating Î”<sub><em>x</em></sub><sup>2</sup> and Î”<sub><em>y</em></sub><sup>2</sup>
are very similar. Using two private methods will keep your code simple.
To test that your code works,
use the client <code>PrintEnergy</code> described in the testing section above.

<p></p></li><li> To write <code>findVerticalSeam()</code>, you will want to first make 
sure you understand the topologial sort algorithm for computing a shortest path in a DAG.
Do <em>not</em> create an <code>EdgeWeightedDigraph</code>. Instead construct a 2d 
energy array using the <code>energy()</code> method that you have already written.
Your algorithm can traverse this matrix 
treating some select entries as reachable from <code>(x, y)</code> to calculate where the seam is located. 
To test that your code works,
use the client <code>PrintSeams</code> described in the testing section above.


<p></p></li><li> To write <code>findHorizontalSeam()</code>,
transpose the image, call <code>findVerticalSeam()</code>,
and transpose it back.

<p></p></li><li>Now implement <code>removeVerticalSeam()</code>. 
Typically, this method will be called with the output of <code>findVerticalSeam()</code>,
but be sure that they work for any seam.
To test that your code words, use the client <code>ResizeDemo</code> described in the testing section above.

<p></p></li><li> To write <code>removeHorizontalSeam()</code>, transpose the image, call <code>removeVerticalSeam()</code>,
and transpose it back.


</li></ol>

<center><b>Optimizations</b></center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>

</p><ol>

<p></p><li>
There is no need to create a new <code>Picture</code> object after removing a seam
â€”instead, you can maintain the color information in a 2D array of integers.
That is, you can defer creating a <code>Picture</code> object until
required to do (when the client calls <code>picture()</code>).
Since <code>Picture</code> objects are relatively expensive, this will speed
things up.

<p></p></li><li>
Reuse the energy array and shift array elements to plug the holes left
from the seam that was just removed.
You will need to recalculate the energies for the pixels
along the seam that was just removed, but no other energies will change.

<p></p></li><li>
Don't explicitly transpose the <code>Picture</code> until you need to do so.
For example, if you perform a sequence of 50 consecutive horizontal seam
removals, you should need only two transposes (not 100).

<p></p></li><li>
Is it faster to traverse the energy matrix in row-major order or column-major order?
<em>Hint</em>: Recall that in Java a "2D array" is really an array of arrays.

<p></p></li><li>
Consider using <code>System.arraycopy()</code> to shift elements within an array.

</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>

</p><ol>
<p></p><li>
Your <code>energy()</code> method implemented the dual gradient energy function.
Try out other energy functions. 

<p></p></li><li> Implement an interactive object-removal feature: The user highlights an area of the
image, and that portion of the image is forced to zero energy.
Rows and columns are then successively removed until every pixel in
that zero-energy region has been removed.
