<p><b>If a valid word can be formed in more than one way, how many times should I return it?</b>
Only once. For example, you should return the word <code>EQUATION</code> only once in 
<a href = "../testing/boggle/board-q.txt">board-q.txt</a> even though there are two
ways to form it.

<p><b>Do In need to return the words in alphabetical order?</b>
No, that is not required.

<p><b>Which data structure(s) should I use to store the dictionary?</b>
It is up to you to decide. A trie is a natural starting point.

<p><b>My program isn't fast enough to get 100%. What can I do to improve performance?</b>
See the <em>Possible Optimizations</em> section below for some ideas. It may be a challenge.

<p>
The directory
<a href = "http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/boggle/">boggle</a>
contains some sample dictionaries and boards for testing.
For convenience,
<a href = "http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/boggle-testing.zip">boggle-testing.zip</a>
contains all of these files bundled together.

<p><b>Dictionaries.</b>
Below are some dictionaries for testing. Each dictionary consists of a sequence
of words containing only the uppercase letters <code>A</code> through <code>Z</code>,
separated by whitespace, 
and in alphabetical order.

<p><b>Boards.</b>
We provide a number of boards for testing. The boards named <code>boards-points[xxxx].txt</code>
are Boggle board that results in a maximum score of <code>xxxx</code> points using the dictionary
<a href = "../testing/boggle/dictionary-yawl.txt">dictionary-yawl.txt</a>. The other boards are designed
to test various corner cases, including dealing with the two-letter sequence <code>Qu</code> and
boards of dimensions other than 4-by-4.

<P>

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress. You do not have to follow these steps.


<ul>

<!--<p><li>
Download the zip file
<a href = "http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/boggle-testing.zip">boggle-testing.zip</a>.
It contains sample dictionaries and boards for testing.
-->

<p><li>
Familiarize yourself with the <a href = "../testing/boggle/BoggleBoard.java">BoggleBoard.java</a>
data type.

<p><li>
Use a standard set data type to represent the dictionary, e.g.,
a <code>SET&lt;String&gt;</code>, a
<code>TreeSet&lt;String&gt;</code>, or a <code>HashSet&lt;String&gt;</code>.

<p><li>
Create the data type <code>BoggleSolver</code>.
Write a method based on depth-first search to enumerate all strings that
can be composed by following sequences of adjacent dice. That is, enumerate
all simple paths in the Boggle graph (but there is no need to explicitly
form the graph).
For now, ignore the special two-letter sequence <code>Qu</code>.

<p><li>
Now, implement the following critical backtracking optimization:
<em>when the current path corresponds to a string that is not a prefix
of any word in the dictionary, there is no need to expand the
path further</em>. To do this, you will need to create a data structure
for the dictionary that supports the <em>prefix query</em> operation:
given a prefix, is there any word in the dictionary that starts with that prefix?

<p><li>
Deal with the special two-letter sequence <code>Qu</code>.


</ul>

<center>Possible Optimizations</center>
</table>

<P>
You will likely need to optimize some aspects of your program
to pass all of the performance points (which are, intentionally,
more challenging on this assignment). Here are a few ideas:

<ul>

<p><li> Make sure that you have implemented the critical backtracking optimization
described above. This is, by far, the most important step&mdash;several orders
of magnitude!

<p><li> Think about whether you can implement the dictionary in a more
efficient manner. Recall that the alphabet consists of only the 26 letters
<code>A</code> through <code>Z</code>.

<p><li> Exploit that fact that when you perform a <em>prefix query</em> operation,
it is usually almost identical to the previous <em>prefix query</em>,
except that it is one letter longer.

<p><li> Consider a nonrecursive implementation of the <em>prefix query</em>
operation.

<p><li> Precompute the Boggle graph, i.e., the set of cubes adjacent to each cube.
But don't necessarily use a heavyweight <code>Graph</code> object.

<!--
<p><li> Consider a nonrecursive implementing of depth-first search.
Seems to be slower in practice.
